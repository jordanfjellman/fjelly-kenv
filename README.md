# My Personal Environment for ScriptKit

## Adding to Kit

1. Clone manually into the `~/.kenv/kenvs`

```shell
git clone git@github.com:jordanfjellman/fjelly-kenv.git fjelly
```

2. Generate the binaries needed to run the scripts by opening the app, going to the "Kit" tab, and running the "Generate bin Files" job.
